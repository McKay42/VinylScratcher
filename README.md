# Vinyl Scratcher
A simple folder-based music player for Android. Does exactly what it says, nothing more and nothing less.

I created this out of frustration back in 2013, because no existing apps supported what I want from a music player (being able to play audio files from folders in the filesystem is unheard of!). Even today, Google Play Music does not support playing from a folder.

### Features
* Plays all audio files in a folder on loop, sorted by filename (natural sorting)
* Mostly navigable with just your thumb on large phones
* Supports playing directly from SD cards
* Regular file browser navigation
* Uses as little battery as possible for a music player
* Dismissable notification with playback controls
* Native lockscreen playback controls on older systems
* Runs on Android 4.1+ (Jelly Bean), so basically everywhere
* Audio is paused if headphones are unplugged
* No ads

### Not-Features
* No album art
* No playlists
* No shuffle
* No equalizer
* No repeat options
* No sorting options
* No casting support
* No audio library scanning
* No background services which drain battery life even while not being used

### Warning
I created this app for myself. If someone else finds it useful, then that's pretty cool. However, I'm not going to implement any feature requests, unless I personally want/need that feature. Feel free to fork and customize, but don't expect PRs to get merged. This was my first Android project, so expect potentially weird code.

## Android Studio

This is a preconfigured Android Studio (version 4.0.1) project, converted from the corpse of an old Eclipse ADK installation.
